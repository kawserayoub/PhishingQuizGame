    "Your inbox looks ordinary at first glance. A delivery update, a payment notice, a message from someone you trust. Then something feels off. This is where the game begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This game puts you in realistic phishing situations that test how well you can spot small details under pressure. The goal is to train your instincts and help you recognize real attacks before they reach you.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is phishing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where someone tries to trick you into giving away personal information, such as passwords, credit card details, or other sensitive data. Instead of breaking into systems directly, the attacker pretends to be someone trustworthy, like your bank, a colleague, or a familiar service, and lures you into taking an action: clicking a link, downloading a file, or logging into a fake website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It works because it targets human attention, not technology. When you’re tired, distracted, or in a hurry, you’re more likely to miss small details, such as an off-looking email address, a slightly wrong URL, or a message that feels urgent. That moment of lowered focus is what phishing exploits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phishing types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Mass phishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic fake emails sent to many people. They often claim to be from a familiar service such as your bank or a delivery company and include a link to click or a file to open. These are the most common type and rely on volume rather than precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Spear phishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted messages written specifically for you or your organization. The attacker uses real details like your name, role, and company to sound convincing. They are harder to detect because the message feels personal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Business Email Compromise (BEC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker pretends to be a boss, colleague, or vendor to request money or sensitive data. It often looks completely legitimate because it uses a familiar tone and formatting. Financial loss is usually the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Credential phishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Emails that lead to fake login pages designed to steal usernames and passwords. The website looks identical to the real one but the URL is slightly wrong. This is how many account breaches start.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Email spoofing\n",
    "\n",
    "Attackers forge or mimic legitimate addresses so the email appears to come from a trusted source. They can manipulate sender names or domain lookalikes. Technical protections such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC help block this, but not all systems enforce them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the critical categories that represent the majority of real phishing threats and show how attackers typically trick users into giving access, money, or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to play?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a series of email scenarios based on real phishing attempts. Each message contains clues that reveal whether it is legitimate or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Read each email carefully. Pay attention to sender details, links, tone, and urgency. When you’re ready, choose **Safe** if you believe it’s real or **Phishing** if you suspect it’s a trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your score increases with each correct answer. The goal is to sharpen your attention and train your eyes to spot the small signals that make all the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security mindset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Good security is not about remembering hundreds of rules. It is about setting a few smart habits that protect you automatically. These are the essentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use two-factor authentication (2FA)\n",
    "Even if someone steals your password, 2FA blocks them from logging in. Use an authenticator app or a physical key rather than SMS when possible. Enable it on every account that supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a password manager\n",
    "A password manager safely stores all your unique passwords and fills them in for you. It removes the need to remember or reuse passwords. Examples include Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create your own memorable password system\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer not to use a manager, use a repeatable structure that keeps passwords unique but easy to recall.\n",
    "Choose a base word that only you know, then attach a short element from the site or app.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Base word: GraniteRiver7!\n",
    "Website: Gmail → GraniteRiver7!Mail\n",
    "Website: Spotify → GraniteRiver7!Music\n",
    "Website: LinkedIn → GraniteRiver7!Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Each password stays unique to its service but follows a pattern that is easy for you to remember and difficult for others to guess. The key idea is consistency without repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Check if your data has been exposed\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: \"Have I Been Pwned\" to see if your email or passwords have appeared in known data breaches. If they have, change those passwords immediately and never reuse them.\n"
